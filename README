This is a small example I created to test calling a simple C function 
in python where the input for the C function is a user defined struct.

To call the python function, the user must first compile the shared
object file for the 'test.c' program. For example, this can be done
by first creating the standard object file 'test.o' then using this
object file to create 'libtest.so' as follows:

        gcc -c -Wall -Werror -fpic test.c
        gcc -shared -o libtest.so test.o

Once 'libtest.so' has been created, the user can then call the python
function 'problem.py' which initializes the struct and calls the C
function 'test' using the command:

        python problem.py
